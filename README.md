Name is just work in progress. We don't mind feedback from you wankers

This is a school project where the class that codes and the class that does graphic design collaborate to create a videogame. 
 We use very basic javascript and whatever editing software the graphics-class is using. 
 
 Our plan is to make a maze where you start in the middle, and have to find your way out. There will also be another character in the 
 maze that is out to chase you, and if caught, will exact the greatest possible suffering upon you.
